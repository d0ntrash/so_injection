#+TITLE: Linux process injection
#+AUTHOR: d0ntrash
** About
Inject shared object files into running processes.

Uses ptrace to interact with the running target process. Overwrites (and restores) instructions
to either call ~dlopen~ or ~__libc_dlopen_mode~ from within the target process.
** Example usage
#+begin_src rust
  use so_injection;

  fn main() {
      let so_path = "path_to_shared_object";
      so_injection::inject_by_name("top", so_path);

      // or by pid:
      so_injection::inject_by_pid(1337, so_path);
  }
#+end_src
** To do
- Injection into (some?) multithreaded processes fails... Needs investigation
